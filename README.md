This project is on display as an example of my work. Anyone can make their stuff look good with enough work, so instead I offer you this project as is to demonstrate what my work looks like when Im on a deadline and under pressure.

This program is a state space search for the solution to a 4x4 sliding block puzzle. The GUI accepts a comma delineated list of unique numbers between 0 (the empty space) and 15. An input can be manually entered  using the buttons on the GUI but it does not currently give the best possible solution when used that way. (For example RULDRULDRUL instead of just U).

If I were to make another commit on this project I would fix the bug mentioned above and improve error handling for unwanted text in the text box. I would also seek to improve performance so that the Randomized puzzles can be solved in a timely manner.
